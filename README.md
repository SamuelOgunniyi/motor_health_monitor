## Features

- ✅ **Command/Odometry Synchronization** with `CmdOdomSync`
- ⚙️ **PWM Saturation Detection** using `PWMSaturationMonitor`
- 🔌 Easily extendable to hardware drivers or simulated environments
- 🧩 ROS-independent, pure C++17
- 🧪 Ready for CI testing and modular integration

## Architecture

---

## Simulation Scenarios

This project includes built-in test simulations that verify:

* **CmdOdomSync** state transitions:
  `SYNCED`, `UNSYNCED`, and `INDETERMINATE`
* **PWM saturation** detection logic with duration tracking

These are implemented in `main.cpp`, and require **no hardware** to run.

---

## Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

* C++17
* CMake ≥ 3.10
* Linux / WSL (tested)

---

## Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/motor_health_monitor.git
cd motor_health_monitor
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

---

## Run the Simulation

```bash
./motor_health_monitor
```

This will:

* Generate synthetic `/cmd_vel` and `/odom` signals
* Simulate a mismatch (non-compliance)
* Trigger saturation conditions and state transitions

The simulation runs entirely from `main.cpp`.
